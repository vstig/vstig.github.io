My first post. No content yet...but stay tuned.

Hoping to post a project around generating song lyrics by different genre soon for my first real post.

The rest of the page is reminders for myself.

{% highlight python %}
def generic_function():
  # To remind me how to do this
  print "things"

generic_function('Vincent')
#=> prints 'things' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Also self-reminder that I should check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
