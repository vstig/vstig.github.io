***Vincent Stigliani***

I am currently a data scientist in Philadelphia, PA. I work for Picwell, a startup providing decision support for healthcare plan selection.
    
I received a BA w/ High Honors from Swarthmore College in 2014, where I studied cognitive science in an interdisciplinary major combining computer science, psychology, and philosophy.
    
Given this background, I am fascinated by how acts of cognition (e.g. language, visual understanding) can be understood through a computational framework, and, going the other way, exploring the ways that "intelligent" behavior can emerge from computational methods.  That will be the motivation for many of these projects. 

I hope to document and share explorations of these interests, and other data science side-projects, on this site.
